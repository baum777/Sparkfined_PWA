### Changed
- **Updated documentation index:**
  - `docs/index.md` – Added new "Documentation Governance (2025-12-04)" section
  - Added links to all new governance documents
  - Added proposed 7-folder structure overview
  - Added key findings summary
  - Added "Design System Documentation (2025-12-04)" section with overview and implementation status

### Removed
- **Cleaned up root directory:**
  - `design_system.md` – Moved to `docs/design/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (governance compliance)

### Context
- User requested review of proposed documentation governance rules (in German)
- User provided comprehensive blueprint for:
  - Root-level restrictions (only README.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
  - 7×7 Rule in `/docs` (max 7 folders, max 7 files per folder)
  - Enhanced `.rulesync` configuration with enforcement rules
  - Archive-first deletion policy
  - Mandatory CHANGELOG updates for doc changes
  - Claude Canvas workflow for AI agents

### Findings
- ✅ **Root is clean** – Only 3 allowed docs (100% compliant)
- ❌ **16 folders in `/docs`** – Exceeds 7×7 rule by 229%
- ❌ **`/docs/design/` has 41 files** – Exceeds limit by 586%
- ❌ **21 root-level files in `/docs`** – Should be max 3-7
- ⚠️ **`rulesync.jsonc` lacks governance enforcement rules** – Only has target configs
- ⚠️ **Archive exists but needs standardization** – Should be `/docs/07_archive/`

### Deliverables
1. **Comprehensive audit** with compliance matrix, folder-by-folder analysis, critical findings
2. **German summary (Fazit)** with before/after comparison, concrete actions, owner assignments
3. **Executive summary** with assessment results, proposed solution, timeline
4. **Quick reference card** for daily use by contributors (workflows, checklists, decision trees)
5. **Documentation changelog** with backfilled entries (2025-11-12 to present)
6. **Updated index** with governance section and key findings

### Proposed Solution
- **Immediate:** Split `/docs/design/` (41 → ≤7 files), move 21 root files
- **Short-term:** Consolidate 16 folders → 7 folders, enhance `rulesync.jsonc`
- **Long-term:** CI checks for 7×7 rule, pre-commit hooks, documentation dashboard

### Proposed 7-Folder Structure
1. `01_architecture/` – System design, API landscape, PWA audit
2. `02_concepts/` – Journal, Oracle, AI roadmap, design tokens
3. `03_specs/` – Tickets, bugs, feature specs
4. `04_process/` – CI/CD, QA, workflows, lint rules
5. `05_guides/` – Setup, deployment, onboarding
6. `06_decisions/` – Lore, ADRs, metrics, pitch deck
7. `07_archive/` – Historical docs, obsolete files

### Next Steps (Owner: Cheikh)
- [ ] Consolidate `/docs/design/` (41 files → max 7) – Priority: 🔴 SOFORT
- [ ] Move 21 root-level files in `/docs` to appropriate folders – Priority: 🔴 SOFORT
- [ ] Merge 16 folders → 7 folders (see governance audit for mapping) – Priority: 🟡 KURZFRISTIG
- [ ] Enhance `rulesync.jsonc` with governance rules – Priority: 🟡 KURZFRISTIG
- [ ] Standardize `/docs/archive/` → `/docs/07_archive/` – Priority: 🟡 KURZFRISTIG
- [ ] Implement CI checks for 7×7 rule – Priority: 🟢 MITTELFRISTIG

### File Mappings
- See Appendix A in `DOCS-GOVERNANCE-FAZIT.md` for complete mapping of all 21 root-level files
- See "Recommended Folder Consolidation" in `DOCS-GOVERNANCE-AUDIT.md` for 16→7 merge plan

### Review Timeline
- **2025-12-05:** Split design folder, move root files (3-5 hours)
- **2025-12-06:** Enhance rulesync.jsonc (30 minutes)
- **2025-12-11:** Complete folder consolidation + follow-up review (4-6 hours)
- **2025-12-31:** Implement CI checks (2-3 hours)
