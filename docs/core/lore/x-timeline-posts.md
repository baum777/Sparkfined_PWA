## PHASE 1: PRE-LAUNCH TEASER (Days -12 to -7)

### **Day -12: The Problem (Hook)**
```
You're not losing because you're dumb.

You're losing because your system is chaos:
• 47 tabs open
• Alerts that don't fire
• Can't remember why you entered
• Tools that only work online

Sound familiar?

There's a better way. 🧵
```
**Visual:** Image of The Scattered Realm NFT concept (chaos)
**Engagement:** Quote tweet with "what's your tab count right now?"

---

### **Day -11: The Philosophy (Part 1)**
```
Trading isn't about the chart.
It's about what you DO with it.

Most traders have:
❌ Scattered data
❌ Forgotten trades
❌ Vendor lock-in

We built a system for:
✅ Clarity over chaos
✅ Memory over instinct
✅ Sovereignty over dependency

This is Sparkfined. ⚡
```
**Visual:** Three Pillars visual (💎📜🔑)
**CTA:** "Learn more: [link to lore]"

---

### **Day -10: The Journey Begins**
```
We're not just building a tool.
We're documenting a transformation.

From blind → sovereign
From chaos → clarity
From degen → OG

The Hero's Journey for traders.
12 stages. No shortcuts.

Stage 1: The Scattered Realm 💀

Are you ready to begin? 🗺️
```
**Visual:** Journey timeline (all 12 stages preview)
**Poll:** "Which stage are you at right now?"
- 💀 Scattered (chaos)
- ⚡ Awakening (found a system)
- 📖 Learning (journaling)
- 👑 Mastery (OG)

---

### **Day -9: The Data Doesn't Lie**
```
Your brain:
"I'm probably around 60% win rate"

Your journal:
45% win rate
FOMO trades = 23% WR
Revenge trades = 12% WR

This is why memory fails.
This is why data wins.

The Journal feature goes live in 3 days. 📜
```
**Visual:** Before/After stats comparison
**Engagement:** "Reply with your ACTUAL win rate vs what you THOUGHT it was"

---

### **Day -8: Zero to Infinity**
```
Most trading tools:
$50/month → Features locked
$0/month → You get nothing

Sparkfined:
$0/month → Full heuristic analysis (<50ms)
0.5 SOL lock → Unlimited AI + OG status

You pay for COMPUTE, not PERMISSION.

This is sovereignty. 🔑
```
**Visual:** Pricing comparison table
**CTA:** "No credit card. No signup. Just open and trade."

---

### **Day -7: The Creed (Part 1)**
```
I trade not blind, but with clarity.
I rely not on hope, but on data.
I own not promises, but my process.

When FOMO calls, I check my journal.
When the market rages, I stay calm.

I am not a gambler. I am a strategist.
I am OG.

This is The Degen's Creed.
Save it. Live it. 📜

Launch in 7 days.
```
**Visual:** Beautiful typography of The Creed
**Engagement:** "Retweet if you're reciting this before your next trade"

[Image: My January losses]

I was trading blind.
No journal. No plan. Just Twitter signals.

FOMO was my strategy. Hope was my edge.

The market punished me. $8,374 gone.
```

## CRISIS/RESPONSE TEMPLATES

### **Market Crash Response**
```
BTC just dumped 15% in 2 hours.

Your emotions:
😱 Panic
😤 Revenge trade incoming
🤔 Should I buy the dip?

Your SYSTEM says:
1️⃣ Check your bias (did it change?)
2️⃣ Check your journal (how did last "dip buy" go?)
3️⃣ Honor your plan (or don't enter)

Clarity > Chaos, especially now.

You are OG. You stay calm. 👑
