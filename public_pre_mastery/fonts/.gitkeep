# Font Directory

This directory is for self-hosted fonts.

## Current Status

**JetBrains Mono:** Using Google Fonts CDN as fallback (see `src/styles/fonts.css`)

## To use local fonts (recommended for production):

1. Download JetBrains Mono from: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/
2. Extract ZIP file
3. Copy these files to this directory:
   - `jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2` (Regular weight)
   - `jetbrains-mono-medium-latin.woff2` (Medium weight, optional)

## Creating Latin Subset (smaller file size)

Use online subsetter: https://everythingfonts.com/subsetter
- Upload JetBrains Mono TTF
- Select: Latin (Basic Latin + Latin-1 Supplement)
- Export as WOFF2
- Result: ~30 KB instead of ~150 KB

## Test if font is working

Open DevTools → Network tab → Filter "font" → Refresh page
- You should see `jetbrains-mono-latin.woff2` loading
- Or `JetBrains+Mono` from Google Fonts CDN (fallback)

In Elements tab, inspect a `.font-mono` element:
- Computed font-family should show "JetBrains Mono"
